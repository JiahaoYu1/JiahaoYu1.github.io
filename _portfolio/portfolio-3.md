## 🔎 Overview

The Bomb Simulator is just a showcase project about all the coding techniques for java that I learnt in Programming 4, such as inheritance, interfaces, various data structures, etc. For this project, we will be simulating multiple bombs exploding on a 2D map, and how those explosions could potentially trigger other explosions.
